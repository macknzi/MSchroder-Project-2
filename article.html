        Lead by Ben Kutil, Graphic Design major Kit Tee redesigned the MICA Decker Library website during the first half of his course in Advanced Web Design.</br></br>

        Kit interviewed students and faculty members to see what features they wanted to have and also delved into what was preventing them from using the Decker site. In general, they all agreed that the current site was functional, but not extremely intuitive. The visual design was dated and the layout was a bit complex; inevitably, the information was seemingly unreachable.</br></br>

        Thus, during Kit's design process, he tried to categorize all of the information the Library had into digestible bites, making a search page, which he felt was the most important part of the site. Kit ended up developing a more user-friendly site with mobile optimization.</br></br>

        As Kit said himself, "I used Bootstrap as the base of this project, and at first I regretted it. After all, I think this project was challenging, not just because of the frustration in using Bootstrap, but with the amount of information that I needed to organize."</br></br>

        In the end, Kit and his ingenuity unveiled a clean and concise redevelopment of the Decker Library site and we're all forging on with an easier navigation system through the impressive collection the Decker Library holds.</br></br>
